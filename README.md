Graph Paper Generator w/ vgl

A frame is on a paper, but invisible. A frame width is paper width - left margin - right margin. A frame height is paper height - top margin - bottom margin. Pixel size, line thickness, and pattern length are the percentage of a height of the frame. Length (pattern length) is applied when line pattern type was selected except SOLID.
